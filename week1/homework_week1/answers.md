# Module 1 Homework: Docker & SQL

### Question 1. Understanding docker first run

Run docker with the python:3.12.8 image in an interactive mode, use the entrypoint bash.
What's the version of pip in the image?

``` $
    (new_environment2024)
    dilip@Dilipkumar MINGW64 ~
    $ docker run -it python:3.12.8 bash
    Unable to find image 'python:3.12.8' locally
    3.12.8: Pulling from library/python
    Digest: sha256:5893362478144406ee0771bd9c38081a185077fb317ba71d01b7567678a89708
    Status: Downloaded newer image for python:3.12.8
    root@a9e7e9378f2b:/# pip version
    ERROR: unknown command "version"
    root@a9e7e9378f2b:/# pip --version
    pip 24.3.1 from /usr/local/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pip (python 3.12)
    root@a9e7e9378f2b:/#
```        
### Answer : 24.3.1

### Question 2. Understanding Docker networking and docker-compose

Given the following `docker-compose.yaml`, what is the `hostname` and `port` that **pgadmin** should use to connect to the postgres database?

```yaml
services:
  db:
    container_name: postgres
    image: postgres:17-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: 'postgres'
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 'postgres'
      POSTGRES_DB: 'ny_taxi'
    ports:
      - '5433:5432'
    volumes:
      - vol-pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  pgadmin:
    container_name: pgadmin
    image: dpage/pgadmin4:latest
    environment:
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: "pgadmin@pgadmin.com"
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: "pgadmin"
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - vol-pgadmin_data:/var/lib/pgadmin  

volumes:
  vol-pgdata:
    name: vol-pgdata
  vol-pgadmin_data:
    name: vol-pgadmin_data
```

- postgres:5433
- localhost:5432
- db:5433
- postgres:5432
- db:5432

### Answer : 
          - postgres:5432
          - db:5432


##  Prepare Postgres

Run Postgres and load data as shown in the videos
We'll use the green taxi trips from October 2019:

```bash
wget https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/green/green_tripdata_2019-10.csv.gz
```

You will also need the dataset with zones:

```bash
wget https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/misc/taxi_zone_lookup.csv
```

Download this data and put it into Postgres.

You can use the code from the course. It's up to you whether
you want to use Jupyter or a python script.


## Docker Run output :-

## Question 3. Trip Segmentation Count

During the period of October 1st 2019 (inclusive) and November 1st 2019 (exclusive), how many trips, **respectively**, happened:
1. Up to 1 mile
2. In between 1 (exclusive) and 3 miles (inclusive),
3. In between 3 (exclusive) and 7 miles (inclusive),
4. In between 7 (exclusive) and 10 miles (inclusive),
5. Over 10 miles

```

SELECT count(*) FROM public.green_taxi_data where lpep_pickup_datetime::date >= '2019-10-01'
and lpep_dropoff_datetime::date < '2019-11-01'
and trip_distance <=1;

-- 104,802

SELECT count(*) FROM public.green_taxi_data where lpep_pickup_datetime::date >= '2019-10-01'
and lpep_dropoff_datetime::date < '2019-11-01'
and trip_distance > 1 and trip_distance <=3;

-- 198,924

SELECT count(*) FROM public.green_taxi_data where lpep_pickup_datetime::date >= '2019-10-01'
and lpep_dropoff_datetime::date < '2019-11-01'
and trip_distance > 3 and trip_distance <=7;

-- 109,603

SELECT count(*) FROM public.green_taxi_data where lpep_pickup_datetime::date >= '2019-10-01'
and lpep_dropoff_datetime::date < '2019-11-01'
and trip_distance > 7 and trip_distance <=10;

-- 27,678

SELECT count(*) FROM public.green_taxi_data where lpep_pickup_datetime::date >= '2019-10-01'
and lpep_dropoff_datetime::date < '2019-11-01'
and trip_distance > 10;

-- 35,189

```

### Answer : 

- 104,802;  198,924;  109,603;  27,678;  35,189

## Question 4. Longest trip for each day

Which was the pick up day with the longest trip distance?
Use the pick up time for your calculations.

Tip: For every day, we only care about one single trip with the longest distance. 

```
SELECT lpep_pickup_datetime::date, max(trip_distance) FROM public.green_taxi_data 
group by lpep_pickup_datetime::date
order by 2 desc;

```

### Answer : 2019-10-31


## Question 5. Three biggest pickup zones

Which were the top pickup locations with over 13,000 in
`total_amount` (across all trips) for 2019-10-18?

Consider only `lpep_pickup_datetime` when filtering by date.

```

SELECT "Zone", sum(total_amount)  FROM green_taxi_data g join taxi_zone t
on g."PULocationID" = t."LocationID"
where lpep_pickup_datetime::date = '2019-10-18'
group by "Zone"
having sum(total_amount) > 13000


```

### Answer : East Harlem North, East Harlem South, Morningside Heights


## Question 6. Largest tip

For the passengers picked up in October 2019 in the zone
named "East Harlem North" which was the drop off zone that had
the largest tip?

Note: it's `tip` , not `trip`

We need the name of the zone, not the ID.

```
select "Zone" as largest_tip_dropoff_zone from taxi_zone
where "LocationID" = (select "DOLocationID" from (
SELECT "DOLocationID",max(tip_amount) FROM green_taxi_data g join taxi_zone t
on g."PULocationID" = t."LocationID" and "Zone" = 'East Harlem North'
where extract (year from lpep_pickup_datetime::date) = 2019
and extract (month from lpep_pickup_datetime::date) = 10
group by "DOLocationID"
order by 2 desc
limit 1) foo )
```
